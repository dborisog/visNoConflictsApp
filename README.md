visNoConflictsApp
=================
This is a Shiny app that visualizes number of wars in different regions of the world within the period of years 1825-2005. 

A part of COW Wars v. 4.0, 1816-2007 ( http://www.correlatesofwar.org/ ) dataset was used in the app, the files were downloaded in 2014-06-12. Some modifications were made to the data, please see 'script.R' file in the repository, mostly subsetting and reshaping, yet five wars had no EndYear. This missing data was added, in the two cases of still ongoing wars I used 2014 as this does not damage my analysis; no scientific resources were used in this data update, I also can not assess the validity of the dataset.
